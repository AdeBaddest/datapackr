}
\value{
A datapackr list object, \code{d}, storing at least 2 dataframes of
   data extracted from submitted Data Pack or Site Tool: a \code{d$data$MER}
   dataframe containing all MER data to be distributed to site level, and/or
   \code{d$data$SUBNAT_IMPATT} containing data in the SUBNAT and IMPATT
